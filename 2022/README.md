|              *Day*              | *Stars* |  *Solution*  |                         *Notes*                         |
|---------------------------------|---------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1: Calorie Counting         |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [go](day01/) | Adding lists of numbers to find the highest             |
| Day 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors    |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [go](day02/) | Using maps to compare strings for the game              |
| Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization  |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [go](day03/) | Finding matching characters (runes in go)               |
| Day 4: Camp Cleanup             |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [go](day04/) | Comparing ranges to find overlap                        |
| Day 5: Supply Stacks            |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [go](day05/) | Parsing strings to find stacks then moving items around<br>This was more of a challenge today with string parsing and stack manipulation |
| Day 6: Tuning Trouble           |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [go](day06/) | Sliding windows and contains checks                     |
| Day 7: No Space Left On Device  |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [go](day07/) | Reading input commands for string manipulation          |
| Day 8: Treetop Tree House       |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [go](day08/) | Searching through a 2d slice to find height values      |
| Day 9: Rope Bridge              |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [go](day09/) | Vector comparisons to check for movement                |
| Day 10: Cathode-Ray Tube        |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [go](day10/) | Tracking a variable set by text commands<br>The first day where part 2 was very different to part 1 |
| Day 11: Monkey in the Middle    |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [go](day11/) | The hardest challenge so far, parsing complex data into a struct<br>Part 2 has a hidden challenge that you have to work out, big numbers can end up small... |
| Day 12: Hill Climbing Algorithm |  ‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [go](day12/) | Path finding through a set of heights<br>Used a map of distance for optimisation |


## Running the code

To run the go code, you must be in this directory before running any of the following commands. You will also need to create `input.txt` files by running;
```
find ./day* -maxdepth 0 -type d -exec touch {}/example.txt \;
```

Any particular day can be executed by running:
```
go run ./dayXX/cmd/main.go
```

To run all days you can instead run:
```
go run ./cmd/runall/main.go
```

To run the tests use:
```
go test -v -count=1 ./...
```
