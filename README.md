# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the annual [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/about) competition. This is a fun, Christmas themed competition with a new puzzle release on each of the 25 days leading up to and including Christmas Day. 

I started taking part in the competition in 2022, although I may go back and fill in some of the previous years' calendars in the future.
